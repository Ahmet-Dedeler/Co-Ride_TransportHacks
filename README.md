## 🌠 Inspiration

✨ Ever noticed how sometimes the journey is just as important as the destination? We were inspired by the idea of not just getting from Point A to Point B, but making that journey memorable, efficient, and eco-friendly! Using Google Cloud ☁️, Streamlit ⭐, GoDaddy Domains ⚙️, & more! Check out our websites: [The App (with GoDaddy Domain!) https://www.co-ride.biz/](https://www.co-ride.biz/), and the [Streamlit API https://co-ride.azurewebsites.net/](https://co-ride.azurewebsites.net/)

## 🚗 What it does
📍 For our awesome commuters: Simply plug in your start and finish spots! Our algorithm 🧠 will light up the best path 🛤 and select the perfect driver 🚘 to whisk you away. Dive into the 'matches' tab to see your ride buddy!

🔧 And for the amazing drivers out there: You're not just a driver, you're a car owner too! Feed in some details about your car, and voila! Know instantly if your vehicle needs a pit stop or some tender loving care.

## 🛠 How we built it
🖥️ Backend Magic:
- 3 fabulous algorithms working hard for you! While one traces the best driver for a commuter based on their routes, the other two are your car's health detectives 🔍, predicting engine status and maintenance needs using some cool regression and classification.
- FastApi connected our algorithm magic to the world out there, with Microsoft Azure lifting them into the cloud. ☁️
- Bid farewell to CSVs! SQL db is our new bestie.

💻 Frontend Glam:
- React is our canvas, where we painted a login, sign-up, and even a bye-for-now (logout) page.
- Our matching page? Lit up with Google Cloud's map API! 🌍 As for setting up your commuting vibes, Google Cloud has our back again.
- All the other jazz? Just smooth frontend inputs dancing 💃 with backend tunes.

## 😓 Challenges we ran into
🔗 Making the backend and frontend hold hands was... tricky.
🌩 Deploying our brainy algorithms into the cloud was no walk in the park either.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of
🚀 Built some power-packed ML models and, not to brag, but our website is looking snazzy!

## 📚 What we learned
🤝 ML isn't just for fancy tech stuff; it's a matchmaker, connecting users in ways we hadn't imagined!

## 🔜 What's next for Co-Ride
1. 🎯 Aiming for an even sharper matchmaking algorithm to make commutes smoother.
2. 🚗 For our dear drivers, expect a quick car health checkup feature that'll be your vehicle's new BFF!
